# My thoughts on project

 I loved working on this project, it was a big challenge, especially in this time frame.

  I gave it my best and tried to put as much as I can in this backed in terms of quality and security.

  For technology I used standard stack of Node.js, MongoDB and express.

  >Time to compleate the project was around 5 days
